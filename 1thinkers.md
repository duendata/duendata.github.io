Duendata is a the product of two distinct views of the world.

>###*Duende*
>Art. Charm or magnestism, a heightened state of emotion and authenticity.

>###*Data*
>Science. The objective picture of things, concerned with relationships and measurements.

Duendata seeks uncanny combinations: stories that make you think, statistical relations that jive with our sense of narrative, and current events through the timeless lenses of reason and imagination.
